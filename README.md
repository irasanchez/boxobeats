# boxobeats

boxobeats is an app I am making to help me practice beat boxing and get out of my comfort zone. If you're interested in practicing too, by all means give it a go! ðŸ˜Š

# usage

1. Head on over to the [site](https://boxobeats.now.sh/).
2. Check out the mini tutorial on the home page.
3. The list of sounds contains names and tutorials for now. I plan to add more features in the future.
4. Each sound can be expanded by clicking the name to see more information.
5. You can use the "add to practice" button to create a small list of sounds to focus on when using the metronome on the other page.
6. When you're done picking what you want to focus on, you'll see them above the metronome where you'll also see a slider that allows you to adjust the amount of beats per minute. The amount of clicks you hear cann currently be adjusted. I may add this in the future.
7. The start/stop button on the metronome plays the sound or pauses it.
8. If you cannot hear it, your device is likely muted or experience audio issues itself.
